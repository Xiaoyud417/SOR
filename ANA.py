These module has been splitted into several modules. 
See SOR.py, omics_attri.py, feature_selection.py, machine_learning.py and prognostic_cluster.py.

We also provide specific codes using jupyter notebook. 
See speech_moics_representation.ipynb, weight_graph.ipynb, Modularity_CCA_metrics.ipynb, Redundancy.ipynb, machine_learning.ipynb and prognostic_analysis.ipynb.
